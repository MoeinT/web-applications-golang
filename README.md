This documentation serves as a beginner-friendly guide to creating a basic web server in Go. It explains key components, how to handle HTTP requests, and how to set up a listener for client connections.

## Hello-world application
### HTTP Handler Function
The handler function processes incoming HTTP requests and sends responses back to the client. Handler functions define what should happen when a user visits a specific URL path. For example, they might return a greeting or dynamically generated content based on the request. Here are some of the important concepts:
1. **http.ResponseWriter:**
    - An interface used to write the HTTP response back to the client.
    - You use methods like Write or Fprintln to send text, HTML, or JSON content as the response.
2. ***http.Request:**
    - A pointer to the http.Request struct that represents the client's request.
    - It contains essential details such as:
        - `Method`: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
        - `URL.Path`: The requested path (e.g., /, /about).
        - `Query Parameters`: A map of query values (e.g., ?name=John).
        - `Headers`: Information like user-agent or authorization.
        - `Body`: The request body (useful for POST or PUT).
3. **The HTTP Server**
    - A web server is responsible for listening to incoming client requests and routing them to the appropriate handlers. Goâ€™s http.`ListenAndServ` function sets up a server. Here are few important components: 
        - **Purpose**: Starts a web server that listens on a specified port.
        - **Parameters**
            - Port (e.g., :8080): The address and port number to listen on.
            - Handler (e.g., nil): The request multiplexer that routes requests. If nil, Go uses its default multiplexer.
        - **Behavior**:
            - If the server starts successfully, it blocks further execution and continuously waits for incoming requests.
            - If the server fails to start (e.g., due to a port conflict), it returns an error.
### Typical Workflow
- Set Up a Handler: Define how the server responds to specific paths.
- Start the Server: Use http.ListenAndServe to begin listening for requests.
- Access the Server: Use a browser or HTTP client to send requests to the server's URL.
- Process Requests: The handler receives the client's request and responds accordingly.
